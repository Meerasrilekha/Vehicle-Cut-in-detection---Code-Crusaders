# Vehicle-Cut-in-detection---Code-Crusaders
This project pioneers a sophisticated detection system employing state-of-the-art machine learning and computer vision methodologies to enhance vehicle safety. Powered by the YOLOv5 model, it achieves highly accurate real-time vehicle detection. By analyzing video inputs frame by frame, the system identifies critical distances between vehicles, promptly alerting drivers to potential cut-in scenarios. Through continuous refinement using machine learning algorithms and robust computer vision techniques, this solution aims to mitigate collision risks effectively and bolster road safety standards.
